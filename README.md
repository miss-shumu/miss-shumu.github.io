# We miss you, Shu-mu.

This github page is used to memorize our dear friend and colleague **Shu-mu Du**, who was a wonderful software developer in database domain when he was alive.

On December 25, 2022, Shu-mu got a high fever after being infected by COVID-19. He was admitted into ICU in time. Despite all possible medical approaches, he left us forever on December 28, 2022. It all happened so suddenly that he didn't even get the chance to say goodbye to his beloved family, friends, and colleagues.

Shu-mu joined the company on August 17, 2011 and has been working on database research and development for the past 11 years. Over the years, Shu-mu demonstrated great dedication and commitment and contributed to multiple releases of the Database. Shu-mu has a can-do attitude. He always volunteered to take challenges to resolve urgent and tough customer issues. Shu-mu had always impressed colleagues with his helpfulness and enthusiasm for life. He shared his expertise and insights with colleagues from time to time. Those sharing scenes seems just happened yesterday. Our colleagues are grateful for Shu-mu’s sharing and help and all miss Shu-mu.

Shu-mu has a 6-year-old boy and elderly parents. Shu-mu’s family loves Shu-mu so much. Shu-mu’s sudden demise threw the family into overwhelming pain and despair. As Shu-mu’s friends and colleagues, we will try our best to help Shu-mu’s family to get through the difficult period.

If you know Shu-mu and want to add any story about Shu-mu, please contact us through email `miss-shumu@proton.me`.

Rest in peace, Shu-mu!
